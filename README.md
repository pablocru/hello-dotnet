# Hello .NET

In my new job, I'll be developing a `Backend` with `.NET`. Since I haven't used it before,
I decided to explore this technology before my role begins. Here, you'll find projects and
exercises that are part of my learning path in `.NET` and `C#`.

## Learning Objective

My main goal is to lear how to create and manage a `REST API`. The project at my job uses
a modern `Frontend Framework`, so a `Full-Stack` application isn’t required.

## Repository Structure

All the workshops are in the `workshops/` folder, where each category has its own subfolder.

- `workshops/00-hello-world/`: Basic templates generated by the `.NET` `CLI`:
  - `dotnet new console`: Template for a `CLI`
    - `dotnet new console --use-program-main`: Template for a `CLI` with `Program.Main`
  - `dotnet new webapi`: Template for a Minimal `REST API`
  - `dotnet new webapi --use-controllers`: Template for a `REST API` with `Controllers`
  - `dotnet new webapp`: Template for a `Full-Stack` Application made with `ASP.NET`
    - Because of my learning goal I decide not to test this template.

## FAQ

### How to run a project
